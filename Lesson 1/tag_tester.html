 		This assignment requires you to use javascript to allow the user to interact with HTML tags. It
 		is due on 6/23/15. Each question should take a few minutes, and none of them are intended to be very 
 		difficult. If you have questions, ask Patrick Do immediately. No excuses will be accepted.
 		I realize some of you have internships, so those with internships will have to work extra hard to finish. I expect
 		those without internships to go above and BEYOND! Use http://www.w3schools.com/
